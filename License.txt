HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED THAT ALL LICENSES DECIDE TO TYPE SECTIONS IN ALL CAPITAL
LETTERS WITH HOPES THAT YOU WILL OFFER YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION OR DISPLAY
EMPHASIS BUT IN REALITY YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO IGNORE IT JUST AS EASILY WHILE
NOTING THAT ANY SORT OF PUNCTUATION IS FORBIDDEN IN THIS SECTION LEADING TO
ONE LARGE RUN ON SENTENCE THAT RESEMBLES THE LICENSE YELLING NON-SENSICAL
JIBBERISH AT YOU WHICH REMINDS ME OF THAT ONE TIME THAT ERIC AND RIVER WROTE
ENTIRE PLAYS BASED ON REAL LIFE EVENTS THAT WERE TAKEN COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT
AND NORMALLY ENDED UP WITH A SUPERFICIAL REPRESENTATION OF THE ANTAGONIST BEING
PSYCHOLOGICALLY DECIMATED BY ERIC THE KNIGHT AND JOSH THE CHRISTIAN WHILE RIVER
THE DRAGON BURNS DOWN THE TOWN BEHIND THEM WHICH PROBABLY WAS A GOOD THING. THE
MIT LICENSE PERHAPS OVERRULES THIS BUT HOW THE HECK WOULD I KNOW IM NOT A LAWYER.
DO I LOOK LIKE A LAWYER TO YOU I DIDN'T THINK SO. JOLLY GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR.
